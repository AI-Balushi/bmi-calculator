# BMI Calculator

This BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a command-line tool built with TypeScript and utilizes the `inquirer` and `chalk` npm packages. It allows users to calculate their BMI by entering their weight in kilograms and height in meters. The program then computes the BMI value and categorizes it into different weight status categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

## Features

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your weight and height, and the program will calculate your BMI and display the result along with your weight status category.
